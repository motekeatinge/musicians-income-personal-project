Myself and many other UK musicians will own our rights and process income through limited companies. In any tax year, it is those companies which receive money, and hopefully hold on to it. Because I have a mortgage, and I don't need to prove my income to my mortgage provider any longer, I take the bare minimum of money out of my businesses. Some years it's as little as 12k, and I pay no tax.
Without a follow up question about these structures, someone like myself who was trying to be precise would not end up describing the actual amount I make, or HOW it ends up supporting me.

There could also be a section which explores how visibility due to releases can generate other income. For some of us, releases have been reduced to a kind of calling card, or reminder to the marketplace that we are here. While we know we may not make significant income from streaming, it leads to an uplift in many other career areas, such as brand endorsement, private parties for corporate or institutional bodies, or lucrative performance fees. 

It would be worth looking at this document which really breaks down what all of those micro streams may be:

Content is coming too free and easy which is harming people who work in the industry and contribute so greatly to it. The excuse streaming platforms give for low rates is that artists earn incomes from various other places, with their services acting as signposts to and encourage fanbase growth and exposure.

I am a 36 year old musician with A* GCSE Music, an A in A-level Music and I went on to get my degree in Music from the Guitar Institute in London. The popularity of streaming with non-musicians or 'consumers' is MORE THAN WORRYING. In no other industry are you expected to work your arse off, for free, sometimes at cost, for many years just to be told you shouldn't expect to make any money from your work: you should just be happy to put it out there. You can, however, expect to sell a t-shirt with your logo on it for 250% the price of an album, and in all likelihood you will sell more of those. I'm sorry, but NO. 

I have spent the last 7 years perfecting the arrangements, mix, master and artwork for my album and I am now £30,000 in debt. All this is highly skilled work. I did my first ever recording on a Tascam 4-track tape machine when I was 11. I used those recordings for my GCSE compositions. Now, I have a Twitch channel where I stream various performance videos and anything music-related I have, to gain exposure, so I am now thinking like someone who owns a TV channel. My point here is that I have acquired so many new skills in recent times that are so far removed from practicing my instrument and voice/writing songs that it makes it even worse to think how highly skilled I am but to feel confident that I will be destined to house-share, renting for the foreseeable future. My brother is fine, he chose the right job, he paid his 15 year mortgage off in 8 years. I may never get on the property ladder. Am I any less skilled than him? Are musical skills any less important than putting someone to sleep and keeping them asleep until the operation is over? After all, we both perform in theatres. And in my brother's own words, being an anaesthetist is a lot like being the bass player in the band - no one notices a good one but you sure as hell notice a crap one. (My brother also plays guitar, sings and records music/videos for his church services)

It is not fair to expect us musicians, or 'farmers' to produce our own content at our own expense, and then let the consumers consume it for free. I have come close many times to thinking F this, if someone as highly qualified and experienced as myself, who spent his entire life dedicated to music, can't see a way to earn any money, then what hope has anyone else got? 

Pre-Covid I was out performing at weddings at least twice every week, honing my skills, perfecting my craft, whilst recording my album and teaching guitar in the midweek. Sustaining myself and saving up for the album 100% from music. I did some research. To put on a basic 10-date mini tour I would need at least £8000. (per show = £150 per man, £100 hotels + £100 petrol). Do you know how many people would need to stream my entire album on Spotify to earn this? I'll tell you. The answer is 1.7 million people. Even at £10 per cd I would have made £17,000,000! So, can you tell me why anybody in their right mind would be happy about streaming? Apart from the consumers, obviously. It's great for them - free music - skip if you don't like it - this then creates laziness and there are podcasts on YouTube that have discussed this already - Spotify listeners have much less patience than CD or vinyl (album) fans. If it's not good in the first ten seconds - SKIP - that's why some musicians will 'play up to the platform' and sacrifice a long intro, one such as Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd, in favour of simply counting 4 in and you're in (Happy - Pharrell). This is not good long term. I have spoken with many guests at weddings and in pubs when I'm playing - most people WANT to support musicians, but when everything is there for free, why would you bother? Well, because people like me will put our guitars down and start investing in Bitcoin instead. Or go and get a job at Tesco. Covid has proved supermarket workers are essential. Music has been bounded around as being essential for mental well-being but I don't feel anywhere near as valued as my dad, a supermarket worker, or my bigger brother, a consultant anaesthesiologist. At least with the Bitcoin route, it is my own fault if I lose it all.

The way I see it (and Elton John too it seems), in 20-30 years' time, we will still be performing songs from the 'golden decades' of music (1950-2005 ish) at weddings/parties, and they will have sailed off into the distance and we won't realise until its way too late that there isn't actually anyone bothered about being a pop or rock star anymore because we all accept no one actually makes any money from it, so just open an Only Fans account instead. A 'singer' I follow on Twitch (I use the term singer loosely) has 2 songs of her band on Spotify. The most played one has 200,000 listens. She regularly has 6000+ people watching her livestream in her underwear, and this happens most days. I am annoyed by her but I also feel for her. She thinks this is just what you have to do to get your music out there. Surely?

The music industry is a joke in its current state and streaming has made it better for consumers and worse for creators. They say hate the game don't hate the players. Quite.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Metal,,Pop,,,,,Rock,,,,,,,,Male,,White British ,Undergraduate degree,"1001-10,000",20-100

I, as the record label for my own recordings, am taking all the financial risk. For example, my last album ""Goodbye Butterfly"" cost over £100K not including VAT to have recorded and promoted. The co-writer I worked with (and his publisher) for this album, didn't contribute to this cost at all, and neither did my publisher. The money came entirely out of my own pocket. It is therefore surely reasonable and fair that I should retain by far the largest share of the revenue generated by my music, and my belief that the current ratio of split between master & publishing revenue is correct and justified.

If you look at all business models within and outside of the music industry, it is always the person or company who fronts up the capital to invest that retains the lions share of the profits (if any). This is a standard business model, and is entirely logical and fair, so why should the music industry model be any different?

My opinion is that if songwriters and publishers want a larger share of the revenue pie, then they should have to contribute to the costs of recording and promoting music proportionately to the record labels / independent artists, i.e. if costs are shared 50/50 between the [songwriters/publishers] & the [record labels/independent artists], then profits should also be split 50/50 between those parties. THAT would be fair. Likewise if the costs were shared 60/40 in the aforementioned example, then profits should be split in the same ratio. 

However, the current situation is that songwriters and publishers don't contribute to the costs of recording and promoting music at all, but they still get a substantial portion of the revenue. Nobody has an issue with this, including myself, as everybody recognises the value of a composition and feels that that should be rewarded financially. But to ask for a larger share than what they're currently receiving, still without contributing to the costs, is blatantly unfair in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,Other genre - Please state,,,,,,,,,Other genre – Please state,,,,,,,,Other genre – Please state,New Age,Classical Pop,Contemporary Classical,Female,,White British ,Undergraduate degree,"100,001-1,000,000","10,000-100,000"

Our major label releases have 165 million streams between them on Spotify which is apparently worth somewhere around £550k. But since our royalty rate is 18%, we would have only chipped off somewhere around £100k's worth of debt while the label has pocketed the other £450k. 

At this point we have most likely generated enough income to equal the money they spent on us but according to our latest statement we are still £500k in the red.

I have self-released all of my albums, at first distributed through Pinnacle, then distributed by Universal for a period, and finally I moved everything to solely on my own website that I built plus an Amazon seller account. I have seen some drop off in sales (similar to all physical formats I think), but my existing audience are quite loyal and keeping more of the gross on each copy has more than made up for missing out on the casual sales I would have got from being stocked in record shops. 

At the same time, when I took all physical distribution in-house I also signed a digital distribution deal with AWAL so my music is on all the streaming and download services. 

This combination has worked well, but my digital income has never risen above a small fraction of the income from direct sales of CDs and Vinyl, despite being heard by thousands of times more people. To give some indication, I generally sell around 4-6000 CDs of each album at £10 each, of which I'm keeping about 85%. My most-played songs on Spotify are at 81,000, 64,000 and 61,000 streams each. Not huge in the grand scheme of things, and I can philosophise it as the start of a pipeline that converts listeners to buying gig tickets or direct downloads, but still not generating enough in actual royalties to really make a difference to my finances. 

I need to maintain the physical media sales to survive. I'm lucky to be in a genre where CDs are still a big thing, and I do very well out of sales at the merch desk at shows (another reason the lack of gigs in 2020 hit me hard!). But if the last physical sales slip and are replaced by streaming then I won't be able to carry on. I'd love digital sales to be the future for ecological reasons - I feel awful posting out chunks of plastic and cardboard around the world every day - but I can't see how the money from it will be fixed enough to allow a career for people like me.",,,,,,,,Folk,,,,,Jazz,,,,,,,,,Rock,,,,,,,,Male,,White British ,Undergraduate degree,"10,001-100,000",1000-10000

Allows people to build brands using musicians music for free.
Tiktok are essentially a broadcaster ... like SKY TV.
Tiktok users are essentially the shows, and like shows on TV they should license the music they use and not be allowed to use it for free. 
Tiktok should also have licenses in place with PROs and pay performance royalties just like tv via PRS.
Instead tiktok has got away with being a music streaming service like Spotify, when it is anything but.
They don't even pay per stream, but per usage, I've personally had over 50million streams on tiktok and received around £200.


Online Advertising - royalties 
When a brand pays for advertising space on tv composers and publishers are paid royalties for every play. When a brand pays Facebook or YouTube for advertising space ... where are the royalties? There aren't any. The shift to online advertising has been rather rapid as brands realise it is more effective than tv. When brands no longer advertise on tv there will be no royalties. This needs to be fixed. 


Tiktok commercial library
Tracks are licensed under blanket deals with library owners/rightsholders. composers do not know the terms of these deals. Tiktok pay library a fee for a years usage, after a year composers are paid depending on those many uses of their track. The only winner is the library who will retain 50% of the total license fee. It's exploitation.

For any user generated content platform, I don't believe anyone should be able to upload content without providing a license agreement to prove they have the rights to broadcast the music. 
No different to television, a brand can't just broadcast an advert with anyone's music without first obtaining a license from the rights holder.",,Classical (Western),,,,,Electronic Dance Music,,,,,,,,,,Pop,,,,,,,,,,,,,Male,,White British ,Other ,"1001-10,000",100-1000

Fortunately, I had good advice and was warned at the outset to avoid them, they are not a good organisation to be involved with and I'd be cautious of any implied endorsement. Their lack of professional integrity is another prime example of how vulnerable independent artists are to exploitation if they are naive and uneducated about the industry.

However with revenue per stream from streaming services so low, that means that artists and labels operating at a low/mid-level do not earn enough to remotely survive.

I co-run a small independent record label and to give an example of the current situation with streaming income, the total number of streams across all artists on the label from Q2 2019 to Q4 2020 was 869,708. Corresponding earnings for almost 1 million streams was just £209.08, which equates at just £0.00024 per stream.

Once the distributor had taken their cut for processing and delivering to streaming services and stores, total earnings were £171.41, which equates to £0.00019 per stream.

I hope that this helps demonstrate that the present streaming model is fundamentally broken for all those but the most famous, highest-level artists, and the streaming companies themselves.",,,,,,,Electronic Dance Music,,Other genre - Please state,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other genre – Please state,Drone,,Ambient,Male,,White British ,"Postgraduate degree (MA, MSc or equivalent)","1001-10,000",1000-10000

I believe this is because streaming has made it difficult to earn revenue from sales because it's so grossly in favour of the consumer. SO overall I would say that my ability to exist primarily as an artist writing music has been overtaken by my need to take on other jobs (in my case teaching) to cover the shortfall. I have earned so very little from streaming, and have even found it difficult to reach audiences through streaming platforms like Spotify (again, it's beginning to seem like a ""who you know"" game to get your music on high-listener streaming playlists), so that I can't see its benefit. I also believe streaming has made it harder for independent labels to invest in band and now most of the onus (ie, recording, touring budget) is on the artist.

A usage centric payment model also seems to be the direction to go as everyone's monthly Spotify subscription significantly contributing to the payment of the top 100 artists vs say the 5 independent artists a user listened to on repeat for a year who get pennies of that annual subscription doesn't seem fair cop. It's also very difficult to get music to the ears of playlisters etc which is both opaque and something that only distributors have access to. Trying to get into the algorythm is chicken and egg as you need engagement in the first place which is difficult if your music is just sitting there. The streaming services have taken the place of magazines for music discovery but the whole experience has become passive for the user and barely penetrable - even with press and radio support, for the creators. And then if you are lucky enough to get sucked into the algorithm, there's little loyalty for next releases - I've seen 3 million streams for the lead single off a bands 2nd album in large part from playlists, followed by no playlisting of any tracks from the follow up album that fit the same brief causing the band to dissipate after streams in the thousands. This yeah I've gone from an incredibly busy previous year on various project, composing, producing, mixing, engineering and the most high profile release of my career, to half a days paid music work since the pandemic started and no support from any of the goverment self employed or music help schemes. The goal is trying to make amazing stuff and to share it with people to put something special, different, resonant and new into the world and this year has been soul destroying on that front and has lead to having to really question whether it's even worth trying to do this commercially and whether or not one is better off just doing something else for a living. This has massively effected my mental health this year and continues to do so. Art and music shouldn't be considered a luxury. It means so much to so many people and gives so much back to society/humanity as a whole. For independent artist and those trying to do something new and different which doesn't fit into the present wider commercial tracks - the present streaming model simply doesn't work.",,,,,,,Electronic Dance Music,,,,,Indie,,,,,Pop,,,,,,,,,,,,,Male,,White European ,Undergraduate degree,"1001-10,000",1000-10000

There is no way people can expect musicians to be able to live off the amount streaming services pay out at the moment without the musician having another source of income. For someone who is only at the start of their journey in the industry, it is horrible to look at the way artists get mistreated and underpaid all for the sake of the middleman getting their cut.

I also believe streaming takes a lot of value away from music for people, as it's not something that people put as much thought into as they used to. For example, with the price of a Spotify subscription for a student (£5 a month) they would only be able to buy 1-2 records in the 80s or 90s and because of that, a lot more thought would have gone into what records that person is going to purchase and listen to. 

Whereas with streaming, paying such a small amount to have almost any song you want at the tap of a button - just gives it so much less value and thought. 

I'm not completely saying streaming should be banished, I just think the prices need to be raised significantly to make it more just for musicians and to help keep them motivated enough, knowing that one day they might be able to make a living off making and playing music. 

There is so much more I could say on this subject but I'm not going to over complicate it.

It would be much better if Spotify pays royalties specific to each listener's consumption. EG if one listener only listens to one track once during their month's subscription, 100% of the artist/label royalty share should go to that artist/label. I think that Bjorn from Abba is arguing this point in an international convention. Before streaming, lots of niche artists could earn a living from selling a few thousand cds or vinyl, but this option is now impossible with Spotify. I would persuade my friends/fans to buy say 500 cds and make a small profit. But now how much do I make from their support? Enough for a cup of coffee if I am lucky. Youtube is much worse than Spotify.

If I listen and follow a band or artist on Spotify I want them to know that. I want them to be able to get in touch with me if I allow them to. Spotify and the big streaming services are the gate keepers to our customers. They use powerful tools to bring more people into their platforms and then allow them to use our music without us being able to properly use the data. 
Spotify have an artists area where you can look at data but it's not that useful, they say you can book tours by using the data but that's not true. 
Reason being that you can't discern between the listeners and followers data. Listens might just be in a Café and the happen to be hearing your music but nothing an actual fan.

we want   fair  pay streaming is  ripping off artist  there has  to be a fair way of being played 

also, streaming playlists are biased and people pay for promotion. who chooses the music?  

for these playlists 


the whole structure is corrupt and   only big artist  profit for streaming 

end streaming now  people music pay  to listen to a whole track 


companies need to stop taking money for the promotion of some artist and ignoring really talented artist because they can  afford to buy promotion on their platform

I accept that there are an exponentially high number of artists self-releasing their music now compared to when I was in a signed band in 2004-2008, 'the pot' is much bigger than 10 years ago.
But streaming-only for small/medium sized bands isn't generating nearly enough earnings to just  break even, let alone pay rent or mortgage money!
In my unsigned bands up to 2010s, we could make enough money from a few gigs, selling CDs and merch, from bandcamp and itunes downloads, and a few syncs to keep going (as well as having a day job of course). We'd earn a few thousands each a year from it, enough to keep touring, rehearsing and recording new material. 
My issue is that now with streaming, only the biggest bands can reach sufficient scale and will be able to keep going. But many -  just as culturally valid artists - will struggle to keep going. Most of my artists friends in France can keep going because of State aid for artists and can at least  break even (with touring and sales) but it's getting harder there too with the loss of download income. They represent a very good indie Paris scene (The Rodeo, Mina Tindle, Jaune...). My fear is that without similar States aid in the UK, local indie scenes will disappear or be drowned within the 65k new tracks uploaded on Spotify each day. 
A lot of artists could get by with a few hundred/thousand sales, but won't ever be able to reach millions of streams. You could argue that 'only the best' bands will be able to keep going and that's always been the case to some extent (who gets signed back in the day) but there should be a better way for artists, composers and songwriters of all sizes to keep producing their art.
Artists that have managed to create a fanbase of a few thousands (hard enough to achieve) won't be able to keep going from streaming only instead of sales. There are alternatives that are positive (looking at you bandcamp!) but the more the better.",,,,,,,,Folk,,,,Indie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Male,,White - Other  ,"Postgraduate degree (MA, MSc or equivalent)",101-1000,100-1000

Our first album did ok. We were on course to pay back our advance. Our second record came out in 2013 and again it did ok, but this time more money was spent on us and we didnt manage pay our advance back. Both of those records sold more physical than streams. Streaming wasnt really part of the equation then. So there was a huge amount riding on the third album. The third album - physical sales weren't great, but the streaming figures were amazing, one of the tracks got 4 million spins, our shows were packing out, lots of people saying they'd discovered us via Spotify - everyone was saying the record was a success. When the statements came in, because the physical was so bad we made absolutely zero £££'s on that record and now our debt to the record label is so vast we are in a hole. That third record, though increasing our fanbase, meant we had to put the band on hold for 3 years while we all worked out how to survive financially, which from a career point of view could have been a total disaster. Our fourth album came out in 2020 and we have been very lucky. But as I type this, my band has had over 25 million streams since 2015, a Mercury Music Prize shortlisted album (2020), and yet we dont seem to have made any significant money from any of it.
